## Code Book

The follwing transformations are applied to the UCI HAR Dataset:

1. The training and the test sets are merged to create one data set.
2. Only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are extracted.
3. Activity numeric labels are replaced with descriptive labels.
4. Gathers the data into columns for subject, activity, feature, measurement type (mean or std) and value.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
